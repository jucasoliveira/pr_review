# And what we can expect

- Now that most of this issue were patched, we can say for sure this threat were diminished, the CVE-2024–3094 were open by redhat.

- It was trully amazing to see that everything happen in a very short period of time, but still shows how the ecosystem are damaged:

  - Open Source projects are often ill maintained and developers often loose interest in continuing maintaining.

  - Some of this projects have high impact and is often overlook by companies that relies on this projects

  - Hopefully we will see something more like Github Sponsors to help those contributors
