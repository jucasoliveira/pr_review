# What is this xz backdoor exploit?

The XZ backdoor exploit involved meticulous malicious modifications to the XZ compression tool's code, allowing unauthorised access or control.

Attackers subtly inserted vulnerabilities within the tool's updates, which were then distributed and used unsuspectingly in various systems.

This breach could compromise the security of systems using the affected versions of XZ by enabling attackers to execute unauthorised code.
