## The Methodology

The GHP is simple and follows an easy-to-remember development cycle:

1. Start: Begin the project with unwarranted optimism.
2. Development: Code however you can. Don't worry about standards or quality.
3. Validation: Does it work? If yes, stop. If no, see the next step.
4. Deadline: Has the deadline arrived? Deliver it as it is and hope the stars are aligned.
5. Repetition: If there's still time, repeat the above steps until luck is in your favor.
