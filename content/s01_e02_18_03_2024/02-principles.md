## Principles of GoÂ Horse

1. YAGNI Extreme: You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) taken to the extreme. You won't just not need it, you won't even think about needing it.
2. Brutal Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS): If the solution works, no matter how ugly or fragile, it's valid.
3. Fail Fast, Fail Often, Fail Forward: If you're going to fail, do it quickly, do it often, and find a way to shift the blame.
