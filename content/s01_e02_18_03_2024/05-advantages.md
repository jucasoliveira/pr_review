## Advantages of Go Horse

- Speed: Why waste time refactoring when you can be writing new bugs to fix later?
- Adrenaline: Each deployment is a new adventure. Living on the edge of disaster has never been more thrilling.
- Surprise: One never knows when everything will crumble. This uncertainty is the spice of a programmer's life.

Go Horse is the art of balancing on the thin line between disaster and genius. It is a methodology for the brave, for those who look at a piece of code and say: "That's a problem for tomorrow's programmer."
Remember: if in the end everything works out, nobody will remember the hacks. Long live Go Horse, the methodology that, against all odds, works… until it doesn't.
