# The ultimate question

# Is devin scamming you ?

No, whats is going on right now on the startup world is a shift of investors, looking to squeeze every corner as possible on the AI trend. Every new aspect or application they deemed the next big product it has become an investment - Without product, without traction , without proof … just as the .com bubble.

And Devin wasn't the first to be this shining company, out of nowhere with founders from freshman credentials, other companies around the world are being well funded by this VC's , Mistral AI, a VC led company how raised 10 of milions and Rabbit inc , who raised more thant 10 million.

These companies, propelled by venture capital, just show us a speculative wave within the tech industry, where the allure of AI's potential overshadows the traditional benchmarks of startup viability.

The AI bubble is growing.
