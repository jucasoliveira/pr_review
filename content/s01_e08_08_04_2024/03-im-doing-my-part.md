So what we have so far from Devin:

- Their promise monumental benefits while delivering nothing of substance.
- Launched a massive PR campaign to garner attention and drive traffic.
- Garner a cult-like following who praise the product and its creators without critical evaluation or tangible proof.

So all of this products branded with AI is just part of the marketing game.

Look must of those products are awesome , yet I'd doubt that 90% of them are just a ChatGPT / Claude wrappers.
