Ive been helping software developers to move into Europe for more than 5 years, and during all this time a lot of engineers have reached out to me looking for help them to become expats.

The sole reason I’ve started this channel were to promote the AI startup I’ve created to help then to understand their chances to move to another country … until it failed and I’ve sold it

So today I want to talk about the software engineer career path, because even though the employment landscape has changed since 2019 , with the advent of remote working there’s still those looking to move to another country.
