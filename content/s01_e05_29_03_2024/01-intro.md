Ive been helping software developers to move into Europe for more than 5 years, and during all this time a lot of engineers have reached out to me looking for help them to become expats. I even created a startup to help them … which I’ve sold it by the way.

So today I want to talk about the software engineer career path, because even though the employment landscape has changed since 2019 , with the advent of remote working there’s still those looking to move to another country.
