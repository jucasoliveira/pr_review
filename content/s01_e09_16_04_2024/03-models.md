# Ai models

- And here we can see the decision started to create friction

- [ ] 1. To be able to perform tasks with AI you'll need layers of models ... thinkin in a good architecture here.
- [ ] 2. Because you'll need to know the users intent and if the model can actually do that taks. Dall-e != ChatGPT ... Computer vision models doesn't and or trained with the same data as a language model
- [ ] 3. After defining the intent, than you inference the model over the data the user are inputing
- [ ] 4. You just added a minimum of 2 layers of heavy lifting computer models ... which requires expensive timing and computing.
- [ ] 5. And all of this under the latency of sending and recieving data trough the internet.
