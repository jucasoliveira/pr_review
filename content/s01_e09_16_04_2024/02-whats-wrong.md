# So whats going on here?

- The problem with ai hardware , is that they don't want to be a phone ... mainly because to be this piece of software requires you to :

  - [ ] Either build a OS from scratch ... which would require a few more years
  - [ ] Use current OS's , like apple or android ... which wouldn't justify you to pay for something that's just a feature

- So what's the best option:

  - [ ] Create a small hardware, you can make loads of interations with it, to diversify yourself from the market.

- And this comes with tradeoffs:
  - [ ] The first is the lack of computer power : With less hability to run the models on your own device, because now you don't have all the power and storage a phone have. You will have to realy on other architecture decisions
  - [ ] Which comes in second , which is Relying on the internet to provide the models.
