- 💰 Don’t assume big companies are safe bets: they can drop products without notice.
- 🏃‍ Use smaller companies that rely on your business: they’ll be more responsive to your needs.
- 🙄 Don’t follow trends blindly: every new version of a technology is a gamble.
- 🎭 Choose technology that your team is proficient in: it’s more important than using popular tools.
- 🔮 Hiring is currently less of a challenge: focus on producing quality products.
