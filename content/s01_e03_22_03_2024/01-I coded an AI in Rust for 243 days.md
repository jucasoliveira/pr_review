# Code review

Hi everyone, I've come to show you how I came to implement TGS, an Open Source AI CLI that you own the model.
The idea of the project is to shift way from third-party API's and give the users the whole product, and open it's source code so more people can contribute.

TGS is open source: https://github.com/warpy-ai/tgs
Its model coded here: https://github.com/warpy-ai/tgs-model
