"In Memory of TGS...Almost."

Just when I thought my project, TGS, was going to have a bit of traction and a lot of interest, like a careless child , who control the ball and they are losing the game they are playing they just take the ball and go home, Github just droped ist own AI for the CLI

So yeah ... at last my project has a total of 7 days of run , now its overshadowed by a large corporation and a lot of people who are just playing with their ball.
