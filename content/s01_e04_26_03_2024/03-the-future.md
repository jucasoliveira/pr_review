## Future projects

I've put TGS under a organization i've created called Warpy. The idea of warpy is to create Open Source AI tools that have to have those principles in place:

- [ ] The tools have to be open source
- [ ] The user have to own the AI, or part of it.
- [ ] Services must be provided within the user interest in mind.

So which orther future projects you will do Lucas ?

I'm glad you asked
