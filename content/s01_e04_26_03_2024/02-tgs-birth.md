# Alright whats the difference

TGS and , event GitHub Copilot CLI, are not a new AI CLI tool on the market. TO be fair, even my javascript project , TerminalGPT already encompensate must of mine and GitHub features , what we were trying to explore here were how to use natural language to interact to your computer.

And we have to be honest here: Natural language is not the most optimal way to interact with your computer.

## Using Script vs Using Natural Language

Script language is the direct interaction with your terminal , it doesnt need any interpretation , is a direct interface with your computer. On the other hand, using natural language, you are going to need to understand what you want to do with your computer.

This is a more complex interaction, and add anothe layer of complexity on top of it.
